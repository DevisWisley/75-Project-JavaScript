# Detect Device Battery
Detect Device Battery functions as a tool to check the battery level depending on the type of device.

## Detect Device Battery typically allow you to:
* Mobile Devices (Android/iOS): These operating systems have a built-in feature to view battery levels. You can usually find it in the settings menu or via the status bar at the top of the screen.
* Computer (Laptop/Desktop): Most operating systems will display a battery icon on the taskbar or system tray indicating the battery level. Clicking the icon may provide more detailed information about battery health and estimated remaining time.
* Web Browsers: While not universally supported, some web browsers have APIs that allow websites to request the user's battery level, but this requires user permission.
* Applications: Mobile applications can be designed to access device battery level information. This allows them to optimize performance or display battery-related warnings.
