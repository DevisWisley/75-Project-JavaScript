# Translator
Translator functions as a tool to translate text or speech from one language to another.  The app uses a variety of technologies, including natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning, to produce accurate and relevant translations.

## Translator typically allow you to:
* Translate text: You can type or paste text in one language, and the app will translate it to the language you choose.
* Translate speech: Some apps can translate spoken conversations in real time. You speak one language, and the app translates it into another through your device's speakers.
* Translate images: Some advanced apps can translate text in images, such as signage, menus, or documents.
* Detect language: Many apps can automatically detect the language of the text or speech you enter, so you don't have to manually select the source language.
* Supports multiple languages: Translator apps generally support multiple languages, with some apps supporting hundreds or even thousands of languages.
